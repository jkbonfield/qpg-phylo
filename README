Covid pipeline
==============

The covid data compiled by Rob is at:

/lustre/scratch125/ids/team117/sam/rmd/data/covid/sars_1549263_sequences_assigned.tsv.xz

Producing a subset
------------------

We can select random subsets using "shuf | head". Eg:

    xz -d < sars_1549263_sequences_assigned.tsv.xz \
      | shuf | head -100 \
      | awk '{printf(">%04d#%s\t%s\n%s\n",NR,$2,$2,$NF)}' > shuf100.fa

[TODO: reimplement shuf using specified random seeds]

2. Creating a true tree to compare against.

It has sequence names along with Pangolin assigned LINEAGE.  The
lineage is of the style A.B.C is a child of A.B which is a child of A.
This is essentially a tree.

We can convert a fasta file with name + lineage to a Newick tree using
"lineage_fa2tree.pl".

    ./lineage_fa2tree.pl shuf100.fa > shuf100.nwk


Align sequences
---------------

We could use MAFFT here to do a better job, but a crude strategy of
getting all the data aligned is to align each to a common reference.

    covid=/nfs/srpipe_references/references/SARS-CoV-2/default/all/fasta/MN908947.3.fa
    ./align_seqs.pl $covid shuf100.fa > shuf100.aln

This aligns using minimap2 and then processes the SAM output POS,
CIGAR and SEQ fields to create reference-coordinate sequences, padded
with Ns.

It's not perfect and no filtering is done currently.

Mafft example:

mafft --auto unaligned.fa | \
  perl -lane 'if (/^>/) {print;next} tr/acgt-/ACGTN/;tr/ACGTN/N/c;print' \
  > mafft.fa



Build trees
-----------

Two methods are compat (Maximum Compatibility) and iqtree3's own
method (Maximum likelihood?).

Use compat.sh which sets PYTHONPATH and runs the compiled compat.

    ./compat.sh shuf100.aln shuf100.aln.compat.tree

(Also see compat options such as reducing number of trees to iterate over.)

Use ~jkb/bin/iqtree3 to build its own tree.

    iqtree3 --redo -s shuf100.aln

This produces shuf100.aln.treefile


Comparing trees
---------------

iqtree3 -rf computes a Robinson-Foulds edit distance between a
pair of trees.  It doesn't use branch lengths, but does tell us about
topology changes.

    iqtree3 -rf shuf100.nwk shuf100.aln.compat.tree
    cat shuf100.aln.compat.tree.rfdist

    iqtree3 -rf shuf100.nwk shuf100.aln.treefile
    cat shuf100.aln.treefile.rfdist

  we are taking as the truth set.

  A paper that uses iqtree3 on covid data.
  Has useful hints on alignment methods and options to iqtree3.  Also
  gives credence to our methodology as we can cite a previous paper.

TODO
====

- Replace sequence record number with dates.

  We see a lot of B.1 spread all over the place.  Maybe these are
  "recent B.1" classifying along side their similar aged other
  variants.

  Ie maybe the weird clustering of ancestral lineages is correct as
  they're not early samples at all.
